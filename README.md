## About

This is a template project for new JavaScript projects, whether making a frontend app, server-side app or CLI tool.

### How to use this project

1. Click _Use this template_ button at the top.
2. Follow the install and run instructions in [docs](/docs/) to get the basic app up and running.
3. Follow the [Customization](/docs/customization.md) instructions to make it your own.

### Purpose

Why does this project exist? I'm tired of running `git init` and `npm init` and starting with an empty repo each time.  I know mostly what my git configs, `package.json` details and docs will look like and I don't want to have to type from memory or copy and paste - I want to get to the core code.

So now I just use this repo as a starting point and reference, to make new projects faster to setup and also to keep them consistent.

This project is deliberately open-ended so you can make choices about your own NPM commands and test framework. The only dependency here is _ESLint_.

For Python projects, see also [py-project-template](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/py-project-template).

### Quickstarts

If you are looking for some simple JS projects which are more detailed than this one, see my other repos:

- [react-create-app-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/react-create-app-quickstart) - build and deploy a React app to GH Pages using GitHub Actions
- [preact-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/preact-quickstart)
- [vue-js-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/vue-js-quickstart)
- [javascript-bundling-quickstarts](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/javascript-bundling-quickstarts) - a couple of JS projects that use a mixture of bundle and compile tools like React, TypeScript and Babel.
- [docsify-js-template](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-js-template) - for running a markdown-based docs site without writing code.
